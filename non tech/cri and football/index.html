                        <p>Pitch-catch is considered out if you catch the ball in one hand.<br>
                            When the fielding team member catches the ball after one bounce, but in one hand, the player who hit the ball is out!<br>
                            
                            First ball = Trial ball<br>
                            The first ball that every batsman will attempt will always be a trial ball just so they can warm up their batting skills and get used to the bowling.<br>
                            
                            If the ball hits the neighbour’s house, window, wall or car, the batsman is out!<br>
                            If the batsman hits the ball directly into the wall of the neighbour’s house, widow or the car, they will have to bear the expenses that follow, and they are out!<br>
                            
                            The winning team will always get to bat first in the next match!<br>
                            The team that wins this match will automatically bat for the next match, because who doesn’t love to bat.<br>
                            
                            The batsman should always leave some space for the wicket to be seen because there is no concept of LBW!<br>
                            The batsman should not cover the whole wicket while batting cause there is no LBW rule. And if you don’t, the bowler will throw a fit.<br>
                            
                            If the batsman thinks the ball is too fast, the bowler should re-bowl the ball!<br>
                            If the batsman feels the ball was too fast, it is too fast. Oh, and that ball will not be counted because clearly, it’s unfair.<br>
                            If the ball goes far out of reach or is lost, the batsman is held responsible.<br>
                            When the batsman hits the ball so far that it’s lost, he will have to replace the ball. <br>
                            The umpire is chosen from the batting team.<br>
                            The umpire will be a player from the batting team because he’ll be sitting on the sidelines. When it’s his turn to bat, someone else will replace him!<br>
                            The last batsman will play without a non-striker batsman.<br>
                            The last man gets to bat without assistance from the other non-striker batsman. Because hey… we can make up their own rules.<br>
                            The team with the extra player will have to lend him to play fielding for the other team!<br>
                            The extra player in the team, usually the worst player will be asked to play for both teams. Obviously because then the powers of both the team will be equal.</p>
