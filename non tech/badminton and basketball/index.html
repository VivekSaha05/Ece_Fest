                        <p>A side has only one ‘set’.<br>
                            The service passes consecutively to the players.<br>
                            At the beginning of the game and when the score is even, the server serves from the right service court. When it is odd, the server serves from the left court.<br>
                            If the serving side wins a rally, the serving side scores a point, and the same server serves again from the alternate service court.<br>
                            If the receiving side wins a rally, the receiving side scores a point. The receiving side becomes the new serving side.<br>
                            The players do not change their respective service courts until they win a point when their side is serving.<br>
                            You need to bring your own racket and shuttlecock.<br>
                            The winner will be awarded with cash prizes.</p>

                        <p>Basketball is a game in which five players from each team play at a time on the basketball court.<br>
                            The aim of the players to score a basket by putting the ball inside the hoop elevated 10 ft above the ground.<br>
                            The team with the ball in possession is the team on the offense, and the opposite one is the team on defence.<br>
                            Once the offensive team has the ball, they have 24 seconds on the shot clock to shoot it towards the basket. If the offensive team either fails to shoot the ball or fails to touch the rim or make the shot, a 24-second shot-clock violation is granted to the offensive team, resulting in a turnover.<br>
                            If the offensive team fails to bring the ball up the court (beyond their backcourt) within eight seconds, an 8-second violation is called, resulting in a turnover.<br>
                            There can be a total of 12 players on the team roster, but only five can play at a time.<br>
                            The game of basketball consists of four quarters of 12 minutes each, and if scores are tied at the end of it, there is a five minutes’ extension called “overtime”.<br>
                            The scoring rules are simple. If you shoot from behind the arc, you will get three points whereas shot from inside the arc receives two points. Also, each free throw is worth a single point.<br>
                            There are a variety of ways to score 1, 2, 3 or 4 points on a single possession. For e.g., While any shot within the three-point arc is considered to be worth 2 points, if the shooter is fouled during the upward motion of the shot, and the shot goes in, an "And-1" occurs. The shooter is granted 1 free-throw (worth 1 point) and if the shooter makes the free-throw, a three-point play is said to be completed.<br>
                            Each team has a fixed number of team fouls, and each player has a fixed number of personal fouls. Exceeding the team-foul limit (5 per quarter in NBA) results in bonus free-throws for the opposing team while exceeding the personal foul limit (6 per game in NBA) results in ejection.<br>
                            A player playing on the court can be substituted from the players on the bench by the coach. A coach can make an unlimited number of substitutions.<br>
                            The winner will be awarded with cash prizes.</p>
